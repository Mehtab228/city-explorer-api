## Overview2

- In this project we linked our backend server to two different API's so it could retrieve data from each one depending on the searchQuery. We then had our frontend site retrieve that data with the keyword 'get'

## Getting Started2

- You don't need to install anything new. For some reason I was asked to redownload axios but outside of that no new programs were downloaded

## Architecture2

- Our backend server uses the keyword 'get' to request data from the two API's we added and then we had our frontend site use the key word 'get' to retrieve data from our backend server. I built seperate components to display the data on react. I still need to style them better.
