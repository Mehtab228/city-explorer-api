## Overview

- In this lab we created a server to host data
- We used the 'GET' key word to retrieve information from our app to retrieve data for the server we created

## Getting Started

- After you create you repo on GITHUB you need to runu npm init
- Next you need to npm install express, dotenvm and cors to help create the server
- Make sure you set your PORT to 3001 in your .env

## Architecture

- We used node.js, JS, REACT, Bootstrap. We used try-catch statmenets with the key word 'get' and async to retrieve data from the our back-end server

## Change Log
